Use colorful initial-based default avatars

== Description ==

Default avatars are used to display an image for users and commenters that have no Gravatar registered. Out of the box WordPress provides default avatars based on abstract images or other generated content. Alternatively, this plugin provides default avatars in the style of user pictures as seen in Gmail and other digital user services. Using the user initials, the colorful generated avatars provide a fresh alternative when visually identifying users.

The default avatars are generated by free placeholder services. Currently the following services are included:
* [Dummy Image](http://dummyimage.com)
* [Ipsum Image](http://ipsumimage.appspot.com)
* [Placehold.it](http://placehold.it)
* [Fake Images Please](http://fakeimg.pl)

Avatar colors are randomly generaged, but when the placeholder service supports customization, options are available in the Discussion settings page.

This plugin is highly extendable through various filters. For example you can:
* Add your own placeholder services, with service options.
* Set the avatar colors on a per-user basis.
* Change the user name field to select the initials from.

== Installation ==

If you download Initials Default Avatar manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/initials-default-avatar/".

Activate Initials Default Avatar in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link. If you're using WordPress Multisite, you can choose to activate Initials Default Avatar network wide for full integration with all of your sites.

This plugin is not hosted in the official WordPress repository. Instead, updating is supported through use of the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/) plugin by @afragen and friends.

== Other Notes ==

1. Initials are based on the user display name as selected on the user profile page. For unregistered commenters the comment author name is used.
